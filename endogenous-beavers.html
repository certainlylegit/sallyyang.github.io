                      <p class="mb-30">The Endogenous Beavers is an economic research-themed parody card game that <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/grace-choo-8a9a88187/">Grace Choo</a> and I designed in 2020, when we were first-year undergraduates at the LSE.</p>
                      <p class="mb-30">It is not for sale and in very limited distribution. For you to have a copy of this, I presume you must have helped either of us immensely in some way. Thank you!</p>
                      <p class="mb-30">This game is a parody of <a href = "https://www.explodingkittens.com/" >Exploding Kittens</a>. If you are familiar with that, you will learn this easily.</p>
                      <p class="mb-30">Let’s get started with the game!</p>
                      
                      <h3>SETUP</h3>
                      <p class="mb-30"> </p>
                      <ol class="mb-20">
                        <li>To start, remove all the Endogenous Beavers from the deck and set them aside.</li>
                        <li>Remove all of the RCT Cards from the deck and deal 1 to each player.</li>
                        <li>Insert the extra RCT Cards back in the deck.</li>
                        <li>Shuffle the remaining deck and deal 4 cards face down to each player.</li>
                        <li>Insert enough Endogenous Beavers back into the deck so that there is 1 fewer than the number of people playing. Remove any extra Endogenous Beavers from the game.
                        </li>
                        <li>Shuffle the deck, and put it face down in the middle of the table. This is your Draw Pile. Also, leave some space on the table for a Discard Pile.</li>
                        <li>Pick a direction (clockwise or anticlockwise), and pick a player to go first.</li>
                      </ol>

                      <h3>TAKING YOUR TURN</h3>
                      <p class="mb-30">Gather all of your cards into your hand and look at them. <b>Do one of the following:</b></p>
                      <h3 class="text-center">PASS</h3>
                      <p class="text-center">Play no cards.</p>
                      <h5 class="text-center">OR</h5>
                      <p class="text-center"> </p>
                      <h3 class="text-center">PLAY</h3>
                      <p class="text-center">Play a card by placing it <b>face up</b> on top of the Discard Pile and following the instructions on the card.</p>
                      <p class="text-center">Some cards will end your turn immediately. Some cards do notーyou can play them as many times as you like without ending your current turn.</p>
                      
                      <p class="mb-30"> </p>
                      <p class="mb-30">End your turn by <b>drawing</b> a card from the top of the Draw Pile into your hand and hoping it’s not an Endogenous Beaver. You can skip this if you have played a Just Assume or a Sabbatical card.</p>
                      <p class="mb-30">Play then continues around the table. The last player who hasn’t died from an Endogenous Beaver wins the game.</p>
                      <p class="mb-30">You won’t ever run out of cards in the Draw Pile because you inserted enough Endogenous Beavers to kill all but 1 player.</p>
                      
                      <p class="mb-30"> </p>

                      <p class="mb-30">Just Assume is a bit weaker, because one Just Assume card skips only one turn.

                      <h3>HISTORY</h3>
                      <p class="mb-30">Grace and I were stuck at home in Singapore during the summer 2020 lockdown. It was then when we became executive committee members of the LSESU Economics Society. Bored, we began work on a new speaker souvenir for the Society's Amartya Sen Club, a weekly seminar featuring academic economists. A game about economic research felt cool and appropriate.</p>
                      <p class="mb-30">After weeks of intense literature review (i.e. playing board games), I proposed adapting the play style of <a href = "https://www.explodingkittens.com/" >Exploding Kittens</a>. I thought that recipients can better recognise our game as a parody if we adapted a popular game. It also helped people learn how to play, though we didn't design the cards expecting people to actually play them. Though game mechanics are not copyrighted, we do not intend to sell this for profit.</p>
                      <p class="mb-30">Grace supplied the art. I digitised them and sent for printing. The card variety was limited by the budget and our first-year undergraduate-level knowledge of econometrics. Nonetheless, the humble Endogenous Beavers was born!</p>
                      <p class="mb-30">Sen Club underwent a sudden rise in popularity in the following year. Copies were shipped to Josh Angrist, Paul Milgröm, Gregory Mankiw, etc., though we're unsure whether they managed to reach the US.</p>
                      <p class="mb-30"><i>If you're wondering why the beavers look so much like cats, a sliiiiight miscommunication between beaver-loving Grace and cat-loving me resulted in the unique beaver-cat amalgamations.</i></p>
                      
                      
                 
                    </div>
